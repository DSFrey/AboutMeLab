            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                I was born at a very early age in Portland, Oregon. This was not to last, however, as my family moved to Cedar Rapids when I was naught but six months old. Cedar Rapids has been my home ever since.
            </p>
            <h2>Schooling</h2>
            <p>
                After graduating from Jefferson High School, I went to Iowa State University to study Materials Engineering. I was also very involed in the music programs, performing in many band, choir, and percussion ensemble concerts.

            <h2>Post-College Activities</h2>
            <p>
                Since the completion of my degree at Iowa State, I have worked a variety of jobs of jobs. I spent several summers as a counselor and worship leader at a summer camp in Muscatine, Iowa. I spent several months as a music ministry intern at New Covenant Bible Church. I was a sales associate at Family Christian Stores for several years until they closed all there stores nationwide. Following that closure, I helped several former employees start a new store to fill the void that had just been created. For about two years I served as the used product manager, where I got to buy and sell all sorts of fascinating books, movies, music, and other items. Following that, I spent some time at the Nordstrom Fulfillment Center working as a third shift packer or doing whatever else they needed that night.

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I am now studying with Delta V Code School. I am pursuing a career in coding and looking forward to exploring the opportunities that come my way.
